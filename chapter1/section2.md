## Design Style Guide

This Guide serves as a guide to any agency who is working with PrimerPeso. It should allow for updating the brand while establishing an overall framework.

# Overall Look & Feel Strategy



PrimerPeso as a web application and a joint project between Code for America and the government of Puerto Rico exists in the government space. In our user research we found that citizens in Puerto Rico had a negative connotation with past interactions with government sites and we wanted to counteract that.

With PrimerPeso, we seek to deliver a pleasant, easy, and informative experience to people and the design facilitates that with the use of an a-typical, fresh color palette, seamless user interactions, and clear, easy-to-read typography.

We intentionally chose a pastel, clean color palette both to reflect the hues of the island of Puerto Rico but also to set the tone that this will be a new and different experience with a government web interface.

# Logo & Color Palette

The logo is a combination of a "1" and a "P" (meaning of course Primer Peso or First Dollar).

This is the main logo as it is used on the web. It should be placed on a white or light background.
