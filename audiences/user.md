## User side: business owner

A Business owner will go to primerpeso.com and answer a set of 10 questions about their business. Once these answers are submitted, PrimerPeso will filter the available incentives on our site and provide a list of custom incentive results.
From the results list, the business owner can review information about each incentive and add the ones they are interested in to the 'cart' feature.
Once ready, with one click the business owner can send their information to the respective agencies managing the selected incentives.

The user does not need to create an account, they just need to complete the additional information section with additional facts about the owner and the business type.
