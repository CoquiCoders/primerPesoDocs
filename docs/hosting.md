# Running PrimerPeso


Service Descriptions

**Hosting: Heroku**

Heroku is a cloud web hosting service specifically geared towards modern web applications. The lowest (non-free) tier is around $35/month, and will be sufficient for both PrimerPeso and Negocio123.


**Email service: Mandrill**

Your first 12,000 emails per month are always free. After that, you pay on a per-thousand-email basis. You'll never pay for more than you use. And Mandrill will build discounts into their payment structure, so your per-email pricing automatically decreases as you send more email.

| Service | Cost |
