## Overall Look & Feel Strategy

PrimerPeso as a web application and a joint project between Code for America and the government of Puerto Rico exists in the government space. In our user research we found that citizens in Puerto Rico had a negative connotation with past interactions with government sites and we wanted to counteract that.

With PrimerPeso, we seek to deliver a pleasant, easy, and informative experience to people and the design facilitates that with the use of an a-typical, fresh color palette, seamless user interactions, and clear, easy-to-read typography.

We intentionally chose a pastel, clean color palette both to reflect the hues of the island of Puerto Rico but also to set the tone that this will be a new and different experience with a government web interface.

## Logo

The logo is a combination of a "1" and a "P" (meaning Primer Peso or 'First Dollar').

This is the main logo as it is used on the web. It should be placed on a white or light background.

Other variations of the logo are possible for promotional purposes. Particularly the theme of a dollar with the PP logo.

As well as a framed dollar, symbolizing the good luck of starting your new business.

## Color Palette

The color palette of PrimerPeso centers around a blue-green. The color palette also incorporates somber, secure colors - navy, and grays - because we want to communicate to our users that this is a safe application, especially for dealing with financial information.

Color values are available in hex values for designing with the web.

## Typography & Font Usage

The two fonts in usage for PrimerPeso are Montserrat and Lato.

These are Google Web Fonts and available for download here:

* [Montserrat](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Montserrat)
* [Lato](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Lato)

Follow the instructions on the Google WebFonts site to install the fonts in your stylesheet (they are already included in the stylesheet, but there are instructions for downloading them to your own computer in order to create design elements away from the web.)

The priority for font usage is readability, so we stick to dark colors for the font and rather large font sizes to best communicate the information.

###Font Sizes and usage

There should be a clear hierarchy on every page between title, important action information, subtitles, and paragraph texts.

Here is an example hierarchy:

For specific details of font sizes, please refer to the style guide.

## Interface Styles

The main two features of PrimerPeso are the 11-question "wizard" that users fill out to determine what they are eligible for, and the results page with information about the various incentive programs.

For both of these, and the interface as a whole, we follow the advice that "less is more." In other words, we want there to be plenty of white space so that the content is readable and takes center stage.

The navbar, over the course of the development of the application, became minimalist in order to let the page's content be the focus. Also - there are not many options in the navbar, so it does not need to draw attention to itself.
