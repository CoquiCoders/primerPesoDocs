PrimerPeso was created to make information around incentives easy to access and use. The Government of Puerto Rico has over 300 million of dollars available in incentives to help small business owners start or grow their business which are not being delivered. This represents a waste of government spending. Lack of awareness is the first barrier: small business don't know about those incentives.

The app initially asks the business owner to reply a set of 10 questions about themeselves and their business. It filters through the available incentives and displays a results page customized to the answers.

The results page provides information about each incentives such as benefit type, agency delivering, cost of application, requirements, average processing time and more. The business owner can add to their cart as many incentives as wanted and in just ONE CLICK all of the requets will be sent to the agencies involved.

Within the next 2 weeks an agency employee will contact the business owner back to move on in the process or to request for further paperwork.

Government agencies can use the data and information collected to find trends & gaps between what they offer and what business owners want as well as redundancies and overlaps with current programs.
